Soldier Security System - Academic Project
 Created a WSN-based system for real-time monitoring of soldierâ€™s health and environment, integrating 
temperature, blood oxygen sensors, and a camera for quick emergency response. Utilized LoRa network for 
efficient, low-power communication, ensuring rapid intervention for enhanced soldier safety.
